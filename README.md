# MKLib - An assortment of extensions for SuperCollider

These are classes and extensions to the SuperCollider language that I use in many things. 

There's a bunch of stuff here. No help files and changed at a whim, but read the code and see it's comments for information :)

## Installation

Open up SuperCollider and evaluate the following line of code:
`Quarks.install("https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/mklib")`
